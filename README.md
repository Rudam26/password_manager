This project is a Password Manager website built with React, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and Express. The application allows users to securely save, edit, and delete their passwords along with the associated website
URL and username. The project is organized into two separate folders, each demonstrating a different method of data storage: local storage and MongoDB.

Features
Add New Password: Save a new password entry with the associated website URL and username.
Edit Password: Modify existing password entries.
Delete Password: Remove password entries from the storage.
Storage Options:
Local Storage: Passwords are stored in the browser's local storage.
MongoDB: Passwords are stored in a MongoDB database.

Folder 1: Local Storage
In this folder, the passwords are saved in the browser's local storage. This is useful for small-scale applications or for demonstration purposes where setting up a backend is not necessary.

Folder 2: MongoDB
In this folder, the passwords are stored in a MongoDB database, providing a more scalable and secure solution for handling user data. The backend is implemented using Express.js.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Backend (MongoDB version): Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
